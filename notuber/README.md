1. Everything has been correctly implemented
	* Correctly retrieves location via JavaScript navigator.geolocation object
    * Correctly sends location (latitude, longitude, username) to server is ride request API
	* Correctly displays location on the map with unique marker. Clicking on marker will display your username and distance away (in miles) to nearest vehicle or passenger.
	* Correctly displays locations of vehicles on the map. Map can handle both cases. Clicking on a vehicle will display username, and mile(s) away from me in an info window. 
2. I did not collaborate with anyone, but I discussed the overarching theme and understanding of this assignment with Ben Solomon and Julia Hedrick
3. I spent approximately 10-12 hours on this assignment
