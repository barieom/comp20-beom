3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

... Great question. I came into this class knowing the basics of HTML and CSS.
... Compared to where I was then, I have gained and learned to tools to

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

... The most important and compelling material I learned in this class is,

... are vulenrable to attacks. Even knowing the bare minimum on the importance
... of web security was a learning experience. Additionally, learning
... about sending and receiving data via JSON is useful. As mentioned
... previously, I am interested in working with data and learning to 
... manipulate and move that around online through application of JSON
... in assignment 2 and 3 was extremely valuable to me.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

... I would like to learn more about data visualization and analytics.
... I frequent r/dataisbeautiful and websites heavy on statistics like

... visualization tools and incorporate them to my personal website.
... More pertaining to this course, I am intrigued by web security and
... and planning to take the course sometime during my college career.
